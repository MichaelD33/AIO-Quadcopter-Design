## This repository contains:

### 1. The schematics and Gerber files for the AIO quadcopter circuit board.

### 2. The 3D printed frame for the AIO quadcopter circuit board 
- (*version 0.4.1 strongly recommended*)

### 3. The Fusion360 assembly file for the AIO quadcopter.

### 4. The test jig folder containing all of the 3D printed parts necessary to build a test stand for the AIO quadcopter (version 0.3 and later) 
- (*The single axis version is strongly recommended over the legacy model*)
- This test stand is designed to operate using this [single axis control program](https://github.com/MichaelD33/SingleAxisController).
