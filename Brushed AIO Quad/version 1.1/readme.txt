In an attempt to decrease the number of parts on the quadcopter circuit board, I removed the 5v regulator and connected the atmega directly to the 1S lipo voltage supply. In this process I changed the center of gravity significantly enough to offset the battery placement onto the arms. For this reason I would suggest working with version 1 over this recent iteration.
