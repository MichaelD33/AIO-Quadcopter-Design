# AIO 3D Printed Frame

---

This 3D printed frame serves as support for the AIO quadcopter PCB. 
The frame was added for two main purposes: vibration dampening and rigidity.

Assembly:

- The quadcopter frame is attached to the PCB using standard [M2 x 6mm](https://www.mcmaster.com/92000a013) screws. 
These screws attach to the quadcopter PCB through the mounting holes at the end of each motor arm. 
The screws are held in place using [M2 nuts](https://www.mcmaster.com/93800a300).

- The frame also features cutouts for vibration dampening components.
