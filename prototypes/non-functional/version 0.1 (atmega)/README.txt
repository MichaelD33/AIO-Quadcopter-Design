/* VERSION 1.0 README */

While the first circuit board design ultimately functioned, it required a number of modifications and did not satisfy my expectations for power consumption and efficiency. In addition, the motor drivers on this version of the quadcopter design came in a BGA package and were incredibly tiny and required significant patience and skill to properly solder. Finally, I also encountered issues with isolating the USB power from battery power which caused a number of issues later on when attempting to interface over serial or program the flight controller.

For these reasons, I would not recommend fabricating this version of the quadcopter. I have included it in the library for documentation purposes only.
